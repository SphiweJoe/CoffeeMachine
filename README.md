# Coffee Machine Project

## Description
The **Coffee Machine** is a Java-based console application that allows users to select their preferred coffee type (Espresso or Latte), choose the roast level (Light, Medium, Dark), and specify the number of coffees to brew. The application then calculates and returns the total cost of the coffee order.

This project leverages Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, including inheritance, loops, user input handling, and **classes** to organize the code for clarity and reusability.

## Key Features:
- **Coffee Selection**: Choose between Espresso and Latte.
- **Roast Level Selection**: Choose from Light, Medium, or Dark roast.
- **Order Quantity**: Specify the number of coffees to brew.
- **Cost Calculation**: The system calculates the cost based on the selected coffee, roast level, and quantity.
- **Interactive User Interface**: The console-based application guides the user through their coffee order step by step.
